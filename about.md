### What is this whole thing about
{{ site.title }} is a showcase of student designers doing some mind blowing design work. With the goal of helping other student design finding other designers to follow them on Instagram.

I will admit that this website is not based on an oringal idea. Insert Steve Job quote here. But is heavily base on [@julesforrest](https://twitter.com/julesforrest) website [womenwho.design](https://womenwho.design/) after I heard of it on the [Design Detail](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details) podcast. It sounded like a cool idea, shedding light on notable women in the design field. I wanted to do something similar but instead I want to be inspired by other student designers who were in similar stages of there careers.

If you want to help my list grow by finding other student designers. Who inspire you, please nominate them [here]({{site.baseurl}}/nominate.html).

### FAQ
---

#### Why Instagram

In short it's the social medium platform I use the most. Instagram also focuses heavily on images which makes it great to see what the designers are up too.
But with that said the system really does not care if your account name is for Instagram or Twitter as long as the account name is correct.

#### How does filtering work

The filtering is not prefect I will admit it. Basically it is a manual process of viewing your work and guessing what category you will belong too. If you want to adjust what categories you fall into you can send us a [email]({{site.baseurl}}/contact.html) saying what category you like.

#### Can I suggest a new category

Totally! Just send us a [email]({{site.baseurl}}/contact.html) suggesting the category.

#### Can you remove me from your list

Of course. If someone has nominated you but you rather not be on the list. Just send us an [email]({{site.baseurl}}/contact.html) or DM us at [{{ site.instagram }}](https://www.instagram.com/{{site.instagram}}) on Instagram and you will be removed immediately.

#### Did people actually ask you these questions? Or are you, Like... Just coming up with these questions yourself?

Uh...Ummm... No. Tons of people asked me these questions. Like all the time. I swear.
